    <h4>
        Object Method this:
    </h4>
        <p>
            This can be used as a subsitute for a general part of an object. I like this because it makes a function very veristle and usable in many instances.

    <h4>
        Chapter Five:
    </h4>
        <p>
            Lots of review. Can add functions within objects. Nested objects are objects with objcts within. There was a lot of similarity with python in this particular part of the reading.
        </p>
        <p>
            Parse and stringify are new concepts. Parse takes a string of data in JSON format and returns an object. Stringify pulls an object of JSON data and returns a full string of all the data.

        <p>
            Regular expression is a cool way to getting specific things from a list or an array that have specific symbols and such you are looking for. It uses special characters and modifiers to help find them.

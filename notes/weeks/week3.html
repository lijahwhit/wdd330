    Summary of Week:
</h2>
<hr> 
    <p>
        Late to the ball game once again. I had a difficult time understanding this week's readings. I did read up on functions a bit more. I'm getting more comfortable with it.

    <h4>
        Object Method this:
    </h4>
        <p>
            This can be used as a substitute for a general part of an object. I like this because it makes a function very veristle and usable in many instances.
        </p>
    <h4>
        Chapter Five: Objects
    </h4>
        <p>
            Lots of review. Can add functions within objects. Nested objects are objects with objcts within. There was a lot of similarity with python in this particular part of the reading.
        </p>
        <p>
            Parse and stringify are new concepts. Parse takes a string of data in JSON format and returns an object. Stringify pulls an object of JSON data and returns a full string of all the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regular expression is a cool way to getting specific things from a list or an array that have specific symbols and such you are looking for. It uses special characters and modifiers to help find them.

    <h4>
        Chapter Six: DOM
    </h4>
        <p>
            DOM. My favorite part. Review. Childnodes will show a list of all the nodes that are children. You can change anything within an html site with javascript. It's a matter of getting the desired part of the site and manipulating it.
            It is better to just add classes to elements to change css rather than in line changes.
        </p>

    <h4>
        Chapter Seven: Events
    </h4>
        <p>
            Using DOM, we can add events to elements on the page when something is interacted with. If one clicks and element, then this happens sort of gig. As with all code, avoid inline events. 
            Keydown, when it goes down. Key press, while it is pressed. Key up, when it goes up.

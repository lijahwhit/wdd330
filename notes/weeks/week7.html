    <h4>
        Chapter Eleven: Further Funtions
    </h4>
    <p>
        I will be honest, I have having a very difficult time understanding this chapter. Function rewriting... don't know when I'll be using that. Cool it is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've tried watching videos and reading other articles on some of the funtions. I stil don't quite understand them, but I also question when I'll be using them.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think I'll just need to find more examples of when things are meant to be used. Once again, not understanding this chapter very well.

    <h4>
        Chapter Thirteen: Ajax
    </h4>
    <p>
        This flew over my head. The team assignment was the most difficult one so far. Had to use instructors code to get it to work. Still can't understand how it's working. I'd have to begin at the start really.

        I'm struggling a lot. Understanding material, even after videos, is close to nonexistent now. May need to push this class a semester.

    <h4>Validating FormsValidating Forms</h4>
I did not know that client-side validation
can automatically return validation properties
so you know specifics about why the input is not valid.
That makes it really easy to show a custom message
to the user telling them what they did wrong.</p>

Note:</p>
addEventListenter("input, )</p>
element.validity.typeMismatch</p>
element.setCustomValidity("string")</p>
element.reportValidity</p>

or set it to a blank string if you want to simply remove
the default message.</p>

remember the pseudo element :invalid</p>

to check with regex you can do:</p>
 variable.test(regex)</p>

I remember I had to use the request options
when dealing with the Google Sheets API For
a personal project.</p>

I will probably watch a video to help me
understand more about request options and when
they are helpful/neccesary.</p>

I'm sure most useful API's require credentials
of some sort.</p>

I want to explore using fetch to post data.</p>

The notes and examples of request options
and data chunking seem super useful, I want
to save this page here for personal future use:</p>



I think I handled checking that fetch was
succesful pretty well in this weeks team assignment.</p>

for using request options:
const request = new Request('string', {
   method: 'GET',
   option: stuff,
})</p>

Seems useful to check return types with 
headers before attempting to process data</p>

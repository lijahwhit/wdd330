    <h4>Validating FormsValidating Forms</h4>
<p>I did not know that client-side validation
can automatically return validation properties
so you know specifics about why the input is not valid.
That makes it really easy to show a custom message
to the user telling them what they did wrong.</p>

<p>Note:</p>
<p>addEventListenter("input, )</p>
<p>element.validity.typeMismatch</p>
<p>element.setCustomValidity("string")</p>
<p>element.reportValidity</p>

<p>or set it to a blank string if you want to simply remove
the default message.</p>

<p>remember the pseudo element :invalid</p>

<p>to check with regex you can do:</p>
<p>variable.test(regex)</p>

<p>I will probably watch a video to help me
understand more about request options and when
they are helpful/neccesary.</p>

<p>I'm sure most useful API's require credentials
of some sort.</p>

<p>I want to explore using fetch to post data.</p>

<p>The notes and examples of request options
and data chunking seem super useful, I want
to save this page here for personal future use:</p>


<p>I think I handled checking that fetch was
succesful pretty well in this weeks team assignment.</p>

<p>for using request options:
const request = new Request('string', {
   method: 'GET',
   option: stuff,
})</p>

<p>Seems useful to check return types with 
headers before attempting to process data</p>

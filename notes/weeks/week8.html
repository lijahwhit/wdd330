    <h4>
        Chapter Eight: CSS3 Transforms and Transitions
    </h4>
    <p>
        I've used translate many times when trying to position elements. Centering or offset. Transforms don't work on inline elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Transitions is pretty familiar. I really enjoy making the webpage look good. Having animations and transtions is a key element in the feel of the site.

    <h4>
        Chapter Twelve: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop
    </h4>
    <p>
        SVG was a bit confusing. Enjoyed drag and drop. You can do some cool stuff with that. Making a drawing board or similar. I like it.

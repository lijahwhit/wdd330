        I can use
    </p>

    <p>
        window.prompt('Please enter your name:');
    </p>

    <p>To get the users name for the highscore table for my project.
Then again, it would probably be fairly simple to make my own form that
uses validation and such.</p>

<p>I may also end up setting the window location with javascript to navigate
between rooms in the game (highscore entry, gameplay room, etc.)
window.location.href = "blah"
pathname also seems useful</p>

<p>Hmmm... interesting:</p>

    <p>window.history.go(-1);</p>

        <p>This could be useful in cases where I don't know exactly where the user 
just came from but I want to send them back.</p>


<p>It may be nice to know the available screen width for mobile
 devices in Javascript</p>

 <p>Learning about injecting html using document.write just makes
 me want to learn more about Angular or React.</p>

 <p>I'm trying to think about how cookies could be useful.
Obviously you can greet a user of the website if you get their name, or
let the server know who is visiting.. hmm. It's surprisingly easy to set them.</p>

<p>I will definitely be using timeouts and intervals for my game project.
Before this class I had never really used data attributes. I bet they 
will be useful for my game too!!! I'm excited to get to work after this 
reading.</p>

<p>remember: htmlelementreference.dataset.datasetnamewhatever;</p>

    <p>I had no idea an event was fired every time you mess with local storage.
remember: addEventListener('storage', (event) => ...
Wow! Geolocation is cool (and creepy). WGS84 ellipsoid</p>

<p>web sockets seem pretty cool. could that be used for multiplayer games?</p>

    <p>good reminders about canvas drawing.</p>

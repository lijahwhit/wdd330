        Chapter Ten: Testing and Debugging
    </h4>
    <p>
        Three types of error. System, programmer and user error. Pretty self explanatory. 
        A few different types errors for each are exceptions, stack traces, and warnings. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Using strict mode can help with finding even the most subtle errors. "Poor style" errors included.
        I think it's smart to add "use strict" in each function that we build.
    </p>
    <p>
        Linting tools test the quality of the code. It helps specify "sloppy" code within your files.
        You can also use online linting services. I think I've used a few in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another way to help eliminate any potential errors is using feature detection. Apparently some browsers
        are unable to use some features programmers use. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Using alerts within your code will also help when doing test runs in your programs and sites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the console is another way for a programmer to see any issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        The debugger keyword can be used. Although you must make sure it is not in any of the code when officially
        "shipping" it out. It apparently will make the program freeze. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Test-driven development. Testing is just programming a program to make sure your program works. 
        There is a lot of work that needs to happen when doing this of course.

    To be honest, this week was a lot of review for me. Although, there were a few concepts that
    I either forgot or learned. Escpecially in chapter 2.

Notes
</h2>
<hr> 
    <h4>
    Chapter One:
    </h4>
        <p>
        Mostly review. Logical operators and bitwise operators were new concepts. Will review for better understanding.
        </p>
    <h4>
    Chapter Two:
    </h4>
        <p>
        There are a lot of different things you can do with arrays. Refer back to online resources
        to know which methods to use. I remeber learning maps. It's been a while. Re-learned a few things.
        Love loops. Favorite part of Javascript.
        </p>
    <h4>
    Chapter Three:
    </h4>
        <p>
        This was my favorite chapter by far. Review yes, but one I enjoyed. I did learn a few things. There are
        a lot of math oriented funtions that I was unaware of. To be honest, most of the callback funtions were new.
        Hoping to use them in the future.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<h3>Summary of Week: </h3><hr> 

<p>This week, I did not anticipate the amount of work I was going to have with all of my classes. 
I did not anticipate the fact that I would forget a few key points from past classes. Refreshing 
has taken some time. That being said, I was unable to finish everything in a timely manner.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the reading from this week. I've always wondered how local storage worked. I never really
set aside the time to actually learn about it. Now that I have, I am grateful I learned it now. 
There is a lot that I can now do with this knowledge. Things I wished I knew how to do on the fly a few
months ago.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed the videos. I myself have always worked from building the mobile version of a webiste,
to the larger screen sizes. The mobile version always has a fantastic foundation to work with.</p>

<h3> Questions: </h3>

<p>None this week.</p>
